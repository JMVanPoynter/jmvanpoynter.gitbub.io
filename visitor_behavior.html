										<h3>Purpose</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The Wiregrass Ranch Sports Campus (WGSC) hosts local and tourism-related events weekly for various sports activities including but not limited to gymnastics, basketball, volleyball, and general fitness. The campus is expected to bring both residential attendees and out-of-town visitors alike to the various tournaments, clinics, and competitions hosted at the location. To determine the impact on tourism to Florida’s Sports Coast, a multitude of statistical methods were utilized to examine how hotel occupancy and revenue, local destination attractions, and general visitor behavior trends might have been impacted by WGSC attendance.</p>

										<h3>Overview</h3>
									</header>
									<p>From January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022, a total of 290 unique local sports, RADD sports, and FSC tourism events were hosted at WGSC and included in this analysis (n= 220, n= 24, n= 46 events, respectively). Throughout the entire study period, the 28 hotel properties captured saw 49.1% of weeks with above-average seasonal occupancy rates (n= 54 weeks). A sample of 11,478,300 devices of both residents and qualified arrivals were captured during the study period. Of the qualified arrivals <1% ever visited the WGSC during the study period (n= 30,995). Of those that visited the WGSC, more than 74% of attendees were considered residents of Pasco County (n = 22,940). WGSC qualified arrivals were 7.7% more likely to stay overnight than non-WGSC visitors (RR, 1.08; CI, 1.07-1.09); However, qualified arrivals that attended a WGSC event spent, on average, 37% fewer days, or about 1 day less, in the destination compared to visitors that did not go to the WGSC. Visitors to the destination who were seen at WGSC were 37.5% less likely to stay more than 2 days in the destination compared to other visitors (RR=0.62; CI,0.60-0.65).</p>
									<h3>Methodology</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The study geography, otherwise referred to as the destination, defined in this analysis encompasses the entirety of Pasco County as defined by the 2019 Census Bureau boundary. Qualified arrivals, also referred to as visitors, met the following criteria: traveled further than 50 miles to the destination based on the devices common evening location (CEL) latitude and longitude to the center of the central latitude and longitude of the study geography; spent more than 4 hours and less than 2 consecutive weeks within the study geography during a single trip; returned to the destination that same year no greater than the 95th percentile of other travelers from the same distance between the destination and their common evening location [Table 2].</p>
									<p>Hotel occupancy (OR) is a quotient of the total room nights booked by room nights available during a given period of time. Weeks defined as having a “High OR” indicated that a particular week surpassed the seasonal expected average occupancy rates observed during that same quarter and year. Throughout the study period, there were 54 weeks with a higher than average seasonal OR. Weeks defined as having a Low OR indicated a lower than average seasonal occupancy rate given the quarter and year of other rates observed (n= 56 weeks).</p>
									<p>The average daily rate (ADR) is assessed to determine how much revenue was earned relative to the total room nights booked. When a week’s ADR surpasses the average expected rate of the quarter and year, that week is defined as having a “High ADR.” The latter of which, we will define as having a “Low ADR.” Throughout the study period, there was a total of 50 weeks with a higher-than-average daily rate for the quarter and year. The remaining 60 weeks of the study period experienced a lower-than-average daily rate.</p>
									<h3>Findings</h3>
									<p>Overall, the findings indicate no relative difference in hotel occupancy or booking revenue among any of the 3 event types hosted at the WGSC. Of the WGSC attendees, approximately 74.0% were Pasco County residents (n=22,940). WGSC attendees that were classified as qualified arrivals spent, on average, 38.5% fewer days, or about 1 day less, in the destination compared to visitors that did not go to the WGSC (Avg. LOS of WGSC attendees, 1.6 days; Non- attendees, 2.6 days). When looking at visitor behavior and engagement with other locations in Pasco County, approximately 36.3% of WGSC attendees did not visit other POIs within Florida’s Sports Coast (n= 2,924); however, when compared with non-WGSC attendees, those that attended the sports complex were 7.1% more likely to visit at least 2 or more POIs during their trip than their counterparts (RR, 1.07; CI, 1.05-1.09).</p>
