									<h2>Objective</h2>
									<p>This project summary will help to showcase my research and understanding of health and data disparities among various demographic audiences. Clean database management of complex systems is integral in limiting the often unseen representation bias present within all data sources. This study was presented at a local conference to both academic instructors and peers.</p>

										<h2>Abstract</h2>

										<h3>Background</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Failure to obtain addresses that can be geocoded for a subset of the study population can limit a study’s validity and power if baseline characteristics vary from the primary study population.</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Objective</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Determine if cases living in areas with high census-tract poverty rates or high rates of under-education at the censustract level were more likely to have addresses that were nongeocodable.</p>
									<h3>Methodology</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Patient’s addresses within the SEER system with a GIS-interpolated latitude and longitude central to the ZIP code provided during the years 2005 and 2015 in Louisiana were included in the analysis. Addresses were individually assessed for misspellings, incorrect address integers, and formatting errors. Patients were categorized as geocodable if an improved GIS quality was observed, all others were coded as nongeocodable. A logistic regression was performed to determine if cases with high census-tract poverty rates or high rates of under-education at the census-tract level were more likely to be non-geocodable. Categorical variables were assessed using the Chi square test. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.</p>
									<h3>Findings</h3>
									<p>Findings indicate that there is an association between geocodable status and census-tract educations level. This association was maintained after adjusting for age, race, gender, BMI, marital status and education. However, no association was found between geocodable status and census-tract poverty level both in the unadjusted and adjusted models. Patients with high rates of under-education at the census-tract level were more likely to have a non-geocodable address compared to patients living in areas of low under-education rates at the census-tract level. Future analysis should investigate type-specific cancer incidence rate differences.</p>
